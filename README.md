# SABO-Garbage-Cleaning-Machine-

- The current scenario in India of garbage cleaning is not automated. From garbage collection to separation, everything is done manually.
- There are some automated systems of garbage cleaning vehicles in India are available only in metropolitan cities. But those are very costly and not affordable in every region in India. So there is a need of automated garbage cleaning system which also reduces human efforts.
- To tackle this problem, a semi-automated battery operated (SABO) garbage cleaning vehicle can be introduced which cleans the garbage effectively . 


##  Objective of project 

-  Replacing conventional brooming method with brush and motor system , which is more efficient in cleaning .
- Keeping the system close packed to avoid air pollution.
- Electric drive control of trolley to minimize required efforts of transportation. 
- Maximum capacity of garbage collection.
- Segregation at the time of collection.


##  Proposed Solution

- A Semi Automatic Battery Operated (SABO) garbage cleaning vehicle. 
- It uses the same principle of manual sweeping method but with a long continuous brush that rotates at certain RPM in an enclosed trolley.
- It also reduces labour effort as well as reduces dust pollution, thus making  the product a social and environmental advantageous.

## Conclusion

- The proposed solution of a SABO garbage sweeping machine theoretically solves the problems faced effectively.
- The estimate of the cost structure of prototyping verifies the economic feasibility of the product.
- The product, when used extensively will prove to be socially and environmentally advantageous.
- In further development solar panel can be integrated to make product self sufficient.
